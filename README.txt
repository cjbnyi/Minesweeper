Hi! Our Minesweeper program should work properly as long as two folders named
"profiles" and "levels", correspondingly, exist on the same path relative to
main. That said, please create these folders first before compiling our source
code. You can leave them empty and our program should still run as expected.

P.S.:
We have already created the folders for you! :D

Thank you!
